as someone who's mostly worked in start-ups (and founded, then crashed one)
i'm often asked by engineers:

> should I take (or ask for) equity when joining start-up X ?

and the corrolary:

> should I accept a start-up (a.k.a low) salary?

never accept a salary significantly lower than what you can live on
reducing your livestyle significantly will make you unhappy, may affect your
family, and reduce your productivity

under-market salary -> smae risks as founders, so same rewards
at market salary -> still taking a risk, you could be working in a more secure
job (most startups fail)

the only exception in my book is when you're technically a cofounder (10%+
hard shares, not equity) _and_ you have significant savings (enough to
comfortably compensate the loss of salary)

know the people
track record of the founder (or the company if validated, i.e. it's been in business, and has
had customers for a couple years)
no or bad track record -> the equity is very probably worth nothing.
you can sitll work there, get a decent pay, and have fun though.
don't refuse the equity, but don't consider it more valuable than a lottery
ticket or a token gesture --- ie. it's not an argument to change your salary
expectations.

know what you're worth
assuming a market salary
first engineer, no funding or seed funding: 5-10%
before series A: 1-2%
after series A: 0.5%

founders may be nice people,
but VCs are cold-blooded and after the money (rightfully so, it's their job)
refuse equity in case of mystery on
- term sheet (part. liquidation preferences, see below)
- last valuation
- size of option pool
- strike price
liquidation preference -> dilution of your equity
beware dilution events

careful about vesting periods

leaving early
"fair market value" = post valuation at last funding round

seek legal advice
