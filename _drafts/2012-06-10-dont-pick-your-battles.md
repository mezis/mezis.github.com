title: Pick your battles (or don't)

summary: |
  A colleague of mine recently quoted Ray Dalio, the infamous founder of
  Bridgewater Associates, saying: "Don't pick your battles. Fight them all."

  After giving this some thought, I ended up thinking it does indeed apply to us
  software engineers.

For those of you who might not care much about bankers, bear with me for a moment.
Bridgewater is one of the "largest" hedge funds in the world.
The colleague was quoting Dalio in "Principles": "Donâ€™t pick your battles. Fight them all."
(as a side note, the colleague I'm mentioning is Greek--there's a lot of irony at pley here).
