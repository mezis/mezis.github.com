The rest of this page is a **recruiter brief**. This will hopefully help you
match my search with what your clients are looking for, and save you time
compared to a phone call!

These notes are about the _ideal_ role I’d consider, as I’d rather not use up
your time for roles that wouldn’t fit! Most of your initial questions should
also get an answer.


#### The role:

* Senior Software Engineer / Lead Engineer.  I’m quite happy not to be a
  “manager” in spite of my recent professional history, especially if the
  company is small or the product/environment are very exciting.
  My minimum ask for en engineering role is 80 k£ per annum, gross.
* I'll consider VP-level roles for team sizes of 10-20, although it's not my
  priority.  The role has to be hands-on and be 50% engineering/architecture
  minimum.
  My min is 95 k£ pa gross.
* I don't take pension/healthcare/equity into account when comparing offers (not
  applicable to me).
* I can be on-site up to 20% of the time (every 5th week). I live in France,
  very close to an international airport.


#### The people:

* A brilliant management team, an generally a team I can learn from.
* Values: passionate, honest, open-minded, empathetic.
* Empowering, prefers “leadership” to “management”, trains others.
* An existing team of engineers (my experience is working with / leading teams
  of 5 to 25).


#### The company:

* Funded, growing.
* Proven market (they have their first paying customers).
* Startup or SMB-sized (up to a few hundred people), or similar sized
  independent organisation in a larger company.


#### Their product:


* Web app or web-centric product.
* B2C, or B2B for tech markets.
* Reasonably ethical (no payday loan or betting companies).
* Targets a global market.


#### The technologies:


* Unix-based technologies (Ruby, C, Go, Python, or Node.JS ; my recent
  experience is mostly Ruby).
* Strong adhesion to open-source, including contributing.
* Nothing Microsoft.


#### The way they work:


* Product-driven organisation.
* Agile/Lean or willing to get there (I have coached my current company into Kanban).
* Adopters of test-driven development or willing to get there.
* Invest in software quality, and manage their technical debt.
* Advocate their work (conference speaking, blog, etc)

Hope this helps!
