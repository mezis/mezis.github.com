[Yarp](http://github.com/mezis/yarp), is a proxy and cache for Rubygems that
speeds up `bundler`.

You can use it locally (easy with [Pow](http://pow.cx)) or use a hosted version.

If you're tired of waiting forever for _Fetching gem metadata from
`https://rubygems.org/`_ to complete, Yarp is for you.

Head over to its [repository](http://github.com/mezis/yarp) for install details!
