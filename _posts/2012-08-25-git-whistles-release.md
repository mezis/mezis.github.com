After a couple of friendly complaints from my colleagues at [HouseTrip](http://www.housetrip.com/), I finally made [`git-whistles`](http://github.com/mezis/git-whistles) into a gem.

Grab it with `gem install git-whistles`; you'll get a handful of [Git](http://git-scm.com/) helpers that hopefully will make your day-to-day development a tad easier.
