title: The case of Haml v. Erb

summary: |
  Is using Haml over plain old Erb just trendy?
  It migh be a fad, but I hope it lasts: my opinion is Haml is superior in every respect to embedded Ruby (or almost any kind of "embedding" templating engine) just like Sass and LESS are to CSS.

  Here's why.

If you already know about Haml and ERb, jump straight to the [comparison](#comparison).

### ERb

Embedded Ruby, or ERb for short, is a templating engine with a syntax that'll be familiar to anyone coming form another framework ([PHP], I'm looking at you). That is, it's plain HTML (or whatever the target language is) with little bits of Ruby code, inside special tags, that get interpreted and replaced when the template is processed

    <% my_var = 'hello, world' -%>
    <% id = 'bar' -%>
    <p>
      <span class="foo" id="<%= id %>"><%= my_var %></span>
    </p>

becomes

    <p>
      <span class="foo" id="bar">hello, world</span>
    </p>

Here's a [deeper intro](http://rrn.dk/rubys-erb-templating-system).


### Haml

[Haml] on the other hand, is not a templating language or templating engine (despite it's website saying so itself), even though the difference is subtle. It's a very compact Ruby-based [DSL] that generates HTML.

Being very closely related to [Sass] and [CoffeeScript], it shares a similar syntax (with significant whitespace).

The example above would look like:

    - my_var = 'hello, world'
    - id = 'bar'
    %p
      %span.foo{ :id => id }= my_var

and "compile" to the same snippet of HTML.

Much like Sass takes care of some of the quirks of CSS, HAML abstracts some quirks of HTML: it takes care of closing tags, escaping, and gives a friendlier syntax to generate attributes; for instance.


### Comparison

ERb has a very slight performance advantage ([1], [2]) over Haml (if using [Erubis], the Rails 3 default), but it'll only be visible on medium-to-high traffic sites (say, starting at 500 rpm). 

I think it depends widely on the *type* of project you're working on. 

ERb will be easier to tackle by inexperienced devs, mostly because it feels similar to what you'll see in PHP or other platforms, hence Hassan's comment above I suppose. 
(as a side note, significant whitespace is rarely an issue in my experience---only very junior devs still use tabs) 

Haml on the other hand has the advantage of **compactness**---it's leaner if you will, without being obsure. It has roughly a **2:1 character ratio** to ERb. It's more top-down-readable. It feels like code, and not like a hackity-hack templating engine. It's way quicker to write. 

Importantly, it also makes you DOM transparently visible in your codeâ€”and enforces it. Let me stress that: HAML guarantees **you won't forget closing tags**.

In my opinion: if quality and low technical debt are important to you (i.e. if you're working on your company's product and not on consultancy work), and you can accept a slight learning curve, Haml is the way to go.

If your team is inexperienced (or outsourced, or has a high turnover or you can't get them to follow conventions, keep using ERb.


Agree? Disagree? This is a hot topic, bordering on flame bait... so feel free to comment!
