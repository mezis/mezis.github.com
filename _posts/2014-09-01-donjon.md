title: Donjon, sharing passwords securely
summary: |
  Donjon is a secure, multi-user store for key-value pairs.

  We built [Donjon](https://github.com/mezis/donjon#donjon) to share credentials
  in a (small) devops team, for services where single user accounts don't make
  sense, e.g.:

  - root passwords for databases and servers
  - root credentials for hosting accounts
  - accounts for web services that don't do multi-user/multi-admin
  - Two-factor tokens for single-user web services.

Donjon uses standards for encryption: 2048-bit asymmetric RSA encryption used to
prime symmetric 256-bit AES CBC encryption with random padding.  In other words,
while the NSA will probably be able to read your data should it get its paws on
it, it's unlikely Joe Hacker will.

[Online tools](https://lastpass.com) exist that serve the same purpose as
Donjon, but simply put: they're generally closed source and host the data
somewhere we don't control. We think the inconvenience of not having a cute
toolbar icon for passwords is trumped by better security.

A typical session with Donjon will look unsurprising:

    $ dj config:get some_server
    Please enter the password for your private key
    > *****
    le_password

    $ dj config:set other_service=s3cr3t
    Please enter the password for your private key
    > *****

Donjon will ask for a password every single time. Behind the scenes, a very
straightforward crypto implementation using OpenSSL does the magic.

We typicaly sync our Donjon store in the team using [Bittorrent
Sync](http://getsync.com/) to avoid a centralised server.
