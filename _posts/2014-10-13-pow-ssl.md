title: Pow + SSL without the hassle
summary: |
  [Pow](http://pow.cx/) is awesome for local web development: it lets you talk to development
  instances of apps using a domain name (`myapp.dev` typically), and without
  worrying about having to start them.

  Unfortunately, using Pow with SSL-enabled web services (or SSL-only services
  like [Routemaster](https://github.com/mezis/routemaster#routemaster) is a bit of a
  [hassle](http://dev.scottw.com/using-ssl-pow), usually involving Nginx.

  Here's a possibly simpler way.
---

The idea is to let Pow do its job, i.e. managing DNS entries for your apps and
spawning them as needed.

All we really need is for "something" to perform SSL termination, and let
clients request HTTPS while Pow keeps serving plain HTTP. Nginx feels overkill:
I don't need a full-fledged webserver, just something to deal with SSL.

The [tunnels](https://github.com/jugyo/tunnels#tunnels) Ruby gem does just that:

    $ gem install tunnels
    $ sudo tunnels 443 80
    127.0.0.1:443 --(--)--> 127.0.0.1:80
    Ready :)

From thereon, all traffic to port 443 will flow to port 80, minus SSL. If you
need the SSL certificate to be valid, the
[tunnelss](https://github.com/rchampourlier/tunnelss) fork is happy to oblige.

Now, Pow promised us we wouldn't have to manually start apps (although you can
if you want to, then using [port
proxying](http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_2.1.4)).

To get the same thing working with SSL and `tunnels`, let's leverage
[launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd), Apple's take on system service
management. It's like `upstart` or the infamous `systemd` (_fanboy alert_: it predates both).

Create a `plist` file in the daemon directory:

```
$ sudo vim /Library/LaunchDaemons/me.dec0de.tunnels.plist
```

with these contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
        <key>KeepAlive</key>
        <true/>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>me.dec0de.tunnels</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
                <string>/Users/mezis/.rbenv/shims/tunnels</string>
        </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

(replacing the path to the `tunnels` executable with your output from `which
tunnels`)

And enable the new service:

```
$ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/me.dec0de.tunnels.plist
```

Voila! `launchd` will keep `tunnels` running no matter what, including across
system restarts.

Launchd can to many more things for you, including running things on a schedule
or at login time. If you want a GUI to setup you `plist` files,
[Lingon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lingon/id411211026) ($4.99) can do that
for you, although digging in the docs works too.

It's good to be lazy.
