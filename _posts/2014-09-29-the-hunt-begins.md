title: How I'm going to land my dream job
summary: |
  It's that time of the decade again: in about 6 weeks, I'm going to pick up my
  bags, leave the [team](http://about.housetrip.com) I've grown to love, and
  find a new (professional) home.

  <p class="dc-summary-sidebar">
  if you have a job for me, <a href="http://dec0de.me/recruiters.html">read this</a>!
  </p>

  Since I'm a geek (I can't really help it), I thought I'd share some data, the
  viewpoint of someone's who's been on both sides several times, and how I'll
  try to nail this.

  Fingers crossed, I'll find a team as fab as the one I'm leaving.
  Let the (job) hunt begin!

---



At HouseTrip, I've been exposed to hiring (amongst other HR topics) from the
"recruiter" side of the fence.

With the help of [talented][sandrine] [headhunters][salim] and of my technical
leads, I've grown my last team from 12 to 27 engineers in 18 months. I've given
92 interviews in the same period (probably a bit more, given I might have lost a
few in Evernote). Before those, I've reviewed the resumes of around 180 people
(projecting this based on the last period I have data for). And according to my
colleagues in HR, _they_ screened about 5 resumes for each profile they passed
on to me.

</figure>

If you take this at face value, the conclusion is:

> when your resume makes it to an HR person, there's a 1.6% chance you'll get
> hired.

Wow, I've managed to scare myself.

I was little anxious already because this time, my hunt may be harder than
usual: I'm tele-working from the lovely city of [Crémieu, France][cremieu] (3500
souls), and I know that very few companies are remote-friendly.  (Sidebar: if
you think hiring remote workers is a bad idea, I think you should stop reading
this and go read [Remote](http://37signals.com/remote/) immediately!)


----------------------

Now that we know a bit more about the (predictable) harsh reality of the
recruiting side of this, let's take a peek at the candidate side.

_Caveat Emptor_: The plural of (my) anecdote is not data---I'm just one data
point.  This said, I'm in the almost-unbelievably lucky situation of having a
[highly- demanded craft][demand]: I'm a software engineer. The number
of us "programmers" is far outstripped by the number of available positions
(particularly in London, Paris, and of course [the US][gov]).  Given the another
anecdotes I've heard from colleagues and
[read](http://compositecode.com/2014/04/09/ive-officially-sent-this-email-over-100-times-to-recruiters-looking-for-net-developers/)
in
[several](http://www.gild.com/2013/09/why-developers-hate-recruiters/)
[places](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6836691), I think there is at
least some generality to this.

Understandably, many companies have trouble hiring, and head hunters are trying
very hard to fill positions using a number of techniques. Let's focus on emails.

Over the past year (since december 2013), I've ceremoniously kept all (well,
hopefully all) emails I've received from recruiters. Bear in mind I wasn't on
the market at the time; my profiles mentioned this where possible (my resume was
hidden on Monster; I was marked as "not available for hire" on [Stack Overflow
Careers][soc]). Here's a breakdown of the emails I received:

- 236 total emails from recruiters (some direct, some from Linkedin);
- 116 "shotgun" emails: random jobs, which were apparently sent my way because
  the spec says "computer" or "programmer";
- 76 "targeted" emails: I'm a half-decent match for the job spec, but the
  recruiter  obviously made no effort to address me personally; I'm just an
  anonymous profile;
- 20 "tailored" emails: the head hunter specifically tried to get _me_ for the
  job, and there's evidence they read my resume, or even researched my
  background in detail.

My archives indicate that 16 emails (7%) were relevant enough for me to send a
detailed response at the time.

Here's what that looks like for the visually inclined:

<figure>
  <img src='/public/2014-09-29-hunt/emails.svg'/>
  <figcaption>Good for my ego. Bad for my OCD.</figcaption>
</figure>

Attribution wise, the majority of those emails came to me through social profiles. Very
close to 50% through are LinkedIn, the rest is harder to determine (or I'm too
lazy). Presumably there's leftovers from a presence on Monster on various resume
databases; there's also a handly of recruiters I'd previously had contact with.

Note that I'm _not_ criticising recruiters. They do a bloody difficult job
without much help from technology. Only a few companies, like
[Workable][workable], try to help them automate part of their
needle-in-a-haystack job---remember the 1.6%? that's their conversion rate.  And
automated matchmaking for recruitment, unlike for your [love
life](http://uk.match.com/), is still a [research topic][semantic-matchmaking].

So, they're just trying to do their job, even if it's annoying. Consider this:
the "shotgun" approach is low cost, and even if marginally successful, low risk.
It's similar to spam mail; it's sufficient if a couple of recipients follow up.

On the other end of the scale, narrow targeting is very expensive. I've seen a
couple of cases where the head hunter _had_ to have spent a day of work before any
contact with me. Yes, it's very flattering. It's also a risky (time) investment
for them... but one that (I presume) is more likely to pay off, as they contact
people who are a good match, and are better equipped to convince.


To wrap this veryinformal study up... I feel bad about not having replied to
most of those emails.  But on the bright side, having all those recruiters (and
hopefully, companies) putetively interested in my little person makes that 1.6%
figure much less scary.

Which brings me to, how am I going to optimize my hunt for the perfect job this
time around?


----------------

Time for a bit of introspection. Let's not make it navel-gazing.

Like many of my fellow software craftsmen, I'm happy when I code, happier when I
share something I've built with others, and happiest when it's used.

I'm also told I'm a good lead and manager, and I believe it's because I'm
fundamentally honest, fair, curious beyond the realm of software, and able to
make decisions even when some facts are missing.

But also like many of my peers, I'm terrified to leave a job: because it mean I
may not be able to exercice my craft, have a stable source of income, or even
worse---to have to do something I don't love in exchange for income.

The web, and our personal networks, are
[littered](http://blog.codinghorror.com/are-you-creating-micromanagement-zombies/)
[with](http://gofragile.wordpress.com/) [horror](http://devdriven.by/fear/)
[stories](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FearDrivenDevelopmentFDD.aspx) of
software cultures gone wrong.
I suspect this decades-long clash of cultures plays no small part in [fueling
depression](http://www.devsanddepression.com/) amongst software engineers.

I really, _really_ don't want to get there. Paranoidly so.

> I want to enjoy
> building software things I can be proud of with people I like.

This last paragraph is my first step of preparing for hunt: writing down what I
want to be doing the next few years.

From there, I detailed and wrote a [handful of paragraphs][brief] that portray
the job I'm after, the company, and the people.



----------------


If you're still reading this last section: this is where the action begins.
My tactical plan for getting hired is:

- list companies,
- ask for intros,
- pimp myself up,
- send out applications,
- manage recruiters,
- go to interviews.

I won't go intro great details as these topics have been covered at length by
others. For instance, About.com has surprisingly good (albeit generic) tips to
[create a target list of
companies](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/companyresearch/a/targetcompanies.htm)
or [asking for a
recommendation](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/referencesrecommendations/a/how-to-ask-for-recommendation.htm).
And of course, Stack Exchange has answers for everything else—including whether
you should call yourself a [programmer or
engineer](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/4951/what-are-the-key-differences-between-software-engineers-and-programmers)
(although I'm pretty sure it's [not settled
yet](http://unsolicited.consulting/article/entrepreneur-is-a-silly-word#comment-1606979014)).


#### Creating a list of companies

This turned out to easy (listing companies) and mind-boggleingly complicated (in
which order should I approach them?)

I know I'd rather like to work in the "web industry", so I started by listing  companies I've interacted regularly during my last gig, or wish I would have, and are centered around an online product. To give examples:
Github, Heroku, and New Relic are on my list, along with a host of less obvious
ones like Datadog, The Guardian, or Twilio.

But then—how to order them? I won't realistically be able to research, and write a cover
letter for, the 50+ companies on my list.

I decided to wear my engineer hat, come up with a list of criteria, and use that
to rank them:

- do I know someone there, or can I get introduced to employees those companies?
- are they known to be remote-friendly?
- are the technologies they use currently a close enough match to my skillset?
- do they have engineering positions open?

Obviously I failed, as I can't figure a way to _weigh_ these criteria; but a few
companies did bubble up, forming a shortlist.


#### Curating my profile

This is really about having a neat ["hire me!"
placard](http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/careers-clinic-how-some-graduates-use-innovative-campaigns-to-land-a-job-566582-Aug2012/)
that inspires confidence.


It's not about hiding anything, or presenting my "achievements" under a
flattering light; rather, it's about making sure they're legible for potential
employers.

In practice, this meant brushing up my resume, having `.doc` and `.pdf` versions
handy (and in sync!), removing the useless extra fluff, and hilighting the key
items at the top of the document.
I'm terrible at this, but that did mean writing my own pitch.
<br/>
As you've understood above, I know by experience that the first 10 seconds
somewhen will spend looking at my resume will be crucial.

I've also tried my best to make sure my main online profiles (Linkedin, Monster,
Angel.co, Twitter) are consistent and have the right information.

Finally, it's becoming quite important to have an online portfolio
of some form. Something that showcases your work.
In our line of work, that's having a Github account: I did my best to update the
open source projects I maintain on [Github](https://github.com/mezis), event
more than usual.

I also rushed to complete a couple of blog articles---this one probaly doesn't
count, but if you're so inclined, to have a read of my recent [software
architecture](/2014/09/resn-routemaster) article.



#### Applying

Remembering what I appreciate when interviewing: cover letters are key.  I used
to read them before the resume (when there was one), because they'd give a tint
(or a taint) to the otherwise-dry resume.  I _particularly_ appreciated cover
letters that were passionate or down-to-earth and factual, but to me, a good one
had to be 1) honest, and 2) specific (not boilerplate).

When there was a cover letter, I could predict whether we'd eventually hire the
person quite accurately (no data on this, sorry).

So I'll be posting posting resumes to my short list of target companies, along
with
carefully written cover letters.
They won't be "crafted" in the sense I'll do my best to impress,
but in an attempt to give a positive gut feeling about the kind of colleague I'd
be, and what I could bring the company.

_Hint:_ I'm pretty sure avoiding
[buzzwords](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/linkedin-top-10-resume-words-to-avoid/)
is important here, in any profession.  Unless you want your key skill in your
new job to be the ability to play [bullsh\*t
bingo](http://www.bullshitbingo.net/cards/bullshit/).

My plan is to target half a dozen companies in the next couple of weeks. I
probably won't be able to do more, as each cover letter takes me several hours.

Interstingly, this is the reciprocal of what I've mentioned about recruiters
above: writing a good cover is higher cost, but hopefully higher reward.


#### Managing recruiters

Unless my situation as a remote worker is more of a trun-off than I think, or [a
bank collapses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers)
again tomorrow, I'm pretty sure I'll be on the receiving end of a lot of emails.


I've written a [recruiter brief][brief] in the hope of avoiding at least some of 30 minute
phone call where head hunters profile candidates, thus saving my time and
theirs.

This time around, my aim is to answer _every_ email. Probably with a little more
organisation to optimize my time spent:

- "shotgun" emails will receive a boilerplate answer, and a link to a fresh
  resume and the brief, to give them a chance to populate their databases with
  correct information;
- "targeted" emails will received a specific answer, the same info, and a
  request for details (if the position is relevant) or a polite decline (if it
  isn't);
- "tailored" emails will get a detailed answer, and if the role is relevant,
  further questions and an offer to have aphone conversation.

Yes, I will answer every single head hunter.
Colour me naive, but I think being polite eventually pays off.

Last time for me was 2011. I just put my resume out there, had a chat
with the first 3 recruiters who pinged me, and was very lucky to land at
HouseTrip in _two weeks_... this time around, I'd rather not rely just on luck.


---------------

I still have a job I intend to do as well as possible. I'm not planning on using
my notice to find a new job; it clashes with my work ethic.

This means all my free time will be consumed by _the hunt_ for the foreseeable
future; I'll sitll answer your comments if any!


Oh, and I plan to brush up an machine learning and prototype a neural-network
based learn-to-rank engine for HouseTrip in my last month here. I'll definitely
write about it :)

Toodeloo!
