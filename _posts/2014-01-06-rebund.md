title: Rebund for 4x faster Travis builds
published: true
summary: |
  Running `bundle install` to get all gems ready is often the longest part of a
  build. Any Rails application will depend on tens of gems; and any gem, besides
  dependencies, may have a fairly large build matrix.

  [Rebund](http://github.com/mezis/rebund) can easily cut your build times by
  75%, saving you time and saving the good folks at [Travis
  CI](https://travis-ci.org/) some money.

Example for an application, [appfab.io](http://github.com/mezis/appfab) (5.3x
speedup):

Example for a gem, [fuzzily](http://github.com/mezis/fuzzily) (2.7x speedup):

Rebund is an alernative to
[bundle_cache](https://github.com/data-axle/bundle_cache), which didn't work
well enough for us on Travis because it relies on gems to be installed (which
partly defeats the purpose).


## How it works

Before your build, Rebund checks with a file server if there's a bundle already
available for your current Ruby VM and version of the `Gemfile.lock`.
Technically, it hashes the output of `ruby --version` and the lockfile.

If there is one, it downloads and unpacks it, then making `bundle install`
blazing fast.

After the build, Rebund packages the bundle (if changed) and uploads it for
future uses.


## Compared to Travis' own caching?

Travis provides a [similar caching
mechanism](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/caching/); unfortunately it's
not available for public repositories.

While implementation details are not public, it seems roughly as efficient as
using Rebund. It's a bit less conservative than Rebund on changes to the
Gemfile, too, meaning it's reuse a branch's previous bundle if any.

We've consciously avoided doing this to avoid difficult-to-debug errors related
to upgrading gems.


## Using Rebund

Head on to the [rebund
repository](https://github.com/mezis/rebund#prerequisites) for installation
details!
