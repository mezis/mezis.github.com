  The general population is quite technology-unsavvy. He're my most recent
  encounter with this ever-so-true nugget of geek wisdom I tend to forget.

  Lesson learned for software developers: listen to your users'
  pain, but wear earplugs. They're often wrong, especially about the
  details.

  Learn their [cognitive biases][availability].
  And [own what you build][parenting].

I'd rather warn you, this story is going to sound silly to seasoned geeks in
the audience. Please bear with me. All characters in this story are
fictional.

As an intro, I like to think that there are two things in "IT" (for lack of
a better term) that no-one has managed to get right in four decades of mass-market
computing: printers and local networks.

In both cases, getting anything to _just work_, even more so in a
heterogeneous (read, Mac + Windows + Linux) network. Even a simple
print/scan/fax machine requires an absurd amount of setup.

My point is no to talk about [lack of standardisation][printing] in
printing, but rather about what happens when you decide to put matters in
your own hands.


### Birth of an office hero

So, we had a crappy Wifi setup in the office. BT brought the fiber in and
set a decent router up, and our office manager paid a wire-laying contractor
to plug in a few cheapo access points.

Of course, as soon as we went past a few tens of users (plus their assorted
array of devices), things went south, and only coffee deprivation makes a
startup more cranky than a bad internet connection.

Being a generally nice person, I stepped up, bought a few [reliable
WAPs][airport], configured them as a [single SSID][ssid] (one 5GHz, one
2.4GHz) to allow roaming, and found the best spots to place them at.

Finally, I ditched the old WAPs, and all was well.
My praises were sung, and I got so much fan mail I had to hire someone.


### The harder they fall

That's when I noticed a change. More often than not, a user having "internet
problems" would ask me for assistance. Soon enough, I found myself
utterring the inevitable [turn-it-off-and-on- again][it] incantation.
Usually successfully.

</figure>

Well, except that day when someone thought it's be a good idea to plug both
ends of the same Ethernet cable in the same switch.

But in general, multiple non-geek teammates were asking me questions, mosts
of them silly (no offense to them, I'd be as clueless on their turf).


### Why this is relevant

While being helpful like this gives me a warm glow of usefulness, it's
probably the best possible use of my time. But hey, it was still a bit of
fun and helped me re-learn a couple valuable lessons for any open-source
software author.


> Users will hold you accountable for what you've built for them.

If, like me, you occasionally build software [libraries][fuzzily] or event
[small][git-whistles] [tools][mrd] for users, trying to help solve their
problems, they will end up having expectations:

You should carefully weigh whether to respond to users' pains: once your
code is out, they'll have a [reasonable expectation][parenting] that you
will maintain it, and possibly beyond what you originally intended.

Even if all you've put online is a tiny hack you've open-sourced, say a
[small library][fuzzily], they'll expect you to keep it up-to-date, working,
and compatible with the kitchen sink. And rightfully so: you own the product
you built.


> Users' signal to noise ratio is low.

When something breaks, users will assume the most top-of-mind part of it
broke. Back in the day, when the Google stopped working, users assumed the
computer was broken when it was their internet connection. In my office Wifi
example, users assume the Wifi is broken when they forget to turn it on on
their machineâ€”probably simply because they heard about a recent Wifi
upgrade.

This is a classic cognitive bias known as the [availability
heuristic][availability]: _people make judgments about the probability of
events by how easy it is to think of examples_.

In most cases, "your gem doesn't work" actually boils down to "I haven't
configured things properly", or "I've used it outside recommemded
parameters/dependencies", which it turns may well mean "I haven't read the
README".

You implicitly accept responsibility for this when you release open source software!

In other words: _caveat emptor_ when using someone else's code, but...
_caveat venditor_ when you're sharing your own. Prepare to show your users
some love and do a bit of handholding!

Not that this should keep you from building and sharing great software!
