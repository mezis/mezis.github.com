The [git-whistles](http://github.com/mezis/git-whistles) now comes with more [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/) integration.

New and updated are

- Updated: `git pull-request` now has proper `--from` and `--to` options.
- New: `git ff-all-branches` to fast-forward all local tracking branches.
- New: `git select` to find the branch for a Pivotal story, thanks to [Pedro](http://github.com/PedroCunha) for that one.

Get them now with `gem install git-whistles`!
